Here are the steps along with the corresponding Git commands to import a project from GitHub to Eclipse:

Open Eclipse: Launch Eclipse IDE on your computer.

Install EGit plugin (Optional): If you haven't installed the EGit plugin in Eclipse, you can do so by going to the Eclipse Marketplace and searching for "EGit." Follow the installation instructions to add Git integration to Eclipse.

Clone the repository:

Open the Git perspective in Eclipse by clicking on "Window" -> "Perspective" -> "Open Perspective" -> "Other" and selecting "Git."
Click on the "Clone a Git repository" button in the Git perspective toolbar.
In the "Clone Git Repository" dialog, enter the repository URL. You can find the repository URL on the GitHub project page. It usually starts with "https://" or "git://".
Click "Next" and follow the prompts to configure the clone location, branch selection, etc. You can choose the default options or customize them as per your requirements.
Click "Finish" to start the cloning process. Eclipse will download the project files from GitHub.
Import the project into Eclipse:

After the cloning process completes, go back to the Java perspective in Eclipse by clicking on "Window" -> "Perspective" -> "Open Perspective" -> "Java."
Go to "File" -> "Import" to open the import wizard.
Expand the "General" folder, select "Existing Projects into Workspace," and click "Next."
In the "Select root directory" field, browse to the location where you cloned the repository. The project should be detected automatically.
Make sure the project checkbox is selected and click "Finish" to import the project into Eclipse.
Now you should have successfully imported the project from GitHub to Eclipse using Git. You can find the imported project in the Project Explorer or Package Explorer view in Eclipse.
